- For Azure DevOps-specific interview questions, [refer here](./interview-questions.md). → This is the main file everyone should look into.

- ⚠️ *Note:* The answers to the interview questions are not yet complete. I will update them shortly.
- ⚠️ *Note:* Answers to interview questions can be approached in multiple ways. It is a __creative process__. I will keep updating the answers over time as I find better ways to present them.

- I am designing the answers to the questions in two formats:
  1. **Short Answers** — Direct responses you can give during interviews. [Refer here](./interview-Answers.md)
  2. **Scenario-Based Detailed Answers** — Helpful for understanding the context and remembering the key points more effectively. [Refer here](./interview-answers-understanding.md)
